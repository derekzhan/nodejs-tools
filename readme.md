# Node.js Tools Collection

This repository is a collection of Node.js-based CLI tools for daily development and work.  
It contains various utilities that help automate, analyze, and simplify common tasks.

## Projects

- **file-structure-analyzer**: Analyze and visualize the file and directory structure of any folder with icons and summary statistics.

- **log-obfuscator**: Obfuscate sensitive information (such as IP addresses, emails, credit card numbers) in log files or directories before sharing. Supports built-in and custom patterns, and efficiently processes large files using Node.js streams.

More tools will be added over time to cover more use cases in daily development.

## Usage

Each tool has its own subdirectory and README with usage instructions.  
Navigate to the specific tool's folder for details.
